## 🌍 Project Overview: A Timeline Study of Covid-19 Cases Globally

This project involves a comprehensive study of Covid-19 with respect to its timeline, exploring the demographic, economic, and public health factors in different countries that have influenced the spread or reduction of the pandemic.
